Hello! My name is Adizzle and I am just a guy currently getting into coding. This README will give you a bit of information about me!

# My Career Passions
I love technology, especially when it comes to video games. Wether its playing by myself or playing with my friends, I realy enjoy playing games. When I grow up I would like to become a game designer. I really think that I would love making games that other people would enjoy, especially when I know they love them.
